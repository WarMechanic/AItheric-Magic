# AItheric Magic
### A lightweight SillyTavern lorebook magic system to weave worlds together in a compelling manner.

Designed with fantasy settings in mind except the actual core system doesn't contain any content. You could theoretically apply this lorebook to any ruleset. 

Has some core concepts that encourage visceral storytelling, but might not be appealing for every (or many a) universe:

- **Magic is everywhere, and everything is magical.**
  > Uniting everything to be magical allows a consistent scale and detailed spectacle, with less AI jargon.

- **Visceral imagery over damage numbers.**
  > Mana as a concept has been entirely rebuked, and replaced with metabolic spellcasting. Damage numbers dropped in favour of brutal fight choreography. 

- **Never forget to emphasise human frailty.**
  > For as long as humans age, people will seek to improve their own lives and defy expectations. 

- **Trying for small token counts.**
  > The lorebook is currently written in the catnip format which is readily and reliably understood by Deepseek. Cuts down a lot of natural language and inheritance minimises overlapping information. Minimum token count of 148, but you should expect ~350 tokens for random activity and ~600 tokens for combat. Subject to change in the future.

# The Magic System

This system runs on aether, a magic potential energy that permeates through roots and crevices of the world. You can't see it, but you will likely be made aware of a lack or abundance of it.

Aether operates with its own physics rules that inform the rest of the world. Individual aether charges have a charge polarity that string together to encode an attribute, something like an element. Every physical material can accumulate Aether up to a capacitance (Æc), and also has a throttle goverened by a flux (ΦÆ). Aether can also interact with the world given an attribute, reagent, and a medium to effect a reaction called a Spell.

When a novice pyromancer wishes to use fire attribute magic, they cast a spell by invoking ambient aether to react with their body in a metabolic process. A novice pyromancer's first spell is usually some form of self-immolation as magic has an immediate effect. Fortunately for pyromancers, there is the study of 'Metamagic' which allows aether to read, displace, project or bind other aether charges. Our pyromancer could collect the fire into a mote and launch it with extreme concentration, though making fire motes requires you study metamagic - or does it?

People don't have to cast spells by themselves either. Delicate glyphs can be inscribed on objects (like a wand) to automatically rewrite aether attributes as a spell is cast, which allows our pyromancer to cast spells of any type given a bit of human ingenuity. Spellcasting peripherals like wands and grimoires can be tailored to specific spellcasters by automating the metamagic, encapsulating fires in motes, and launch to a single action.

That's the gist of it, but creating the aether rules lead to emergent explanation for many things like dragon breath and guilds/parties, as well as exploration of novel 'magic' ideas: implicit information warfare and spell automation being my favourites.
